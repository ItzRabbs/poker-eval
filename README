This repository contains pokersource poker-eval as well as
Hand Distribution parsing code for Hold'em and Omaha.

poker-eval is a C library to evaluate poker hands. The result of the
evalution for a given hand is a number. The general idea is that if
the evalution of your hand is lower than the evaluation of the hand of
your opponent, you lose. Many poker variants are supported (draw,
holdem, omaha, etc.) and more can be added.  poker-eval is designed
for speed so that it can be used within poker simulation software
using either exhaustive exploration or Monte Carlo.

The poker-eval library is Free Software and is released under the
terms of the GNU General Public License. See the COPYING file in the
root directory of the distribution.

The Hold'em Hand distribution code is from James Devlin.

Omaha Hand Distrbution parsing code is original by Atin Malaviya using the
same interface as James' Hold'em code. The input text syntax is different
for Omaha and follows the Omaha Equilab syntax.

This repository contains pokersource poker-eval as well as
Hand Distribution parsing code for Hold'em and Omaha.

poker-eval is a C library to evaluate poker hands. The result of the
evalution for a given hand is a number. The general idea is that if
the evalution of your hand is lower than the evaluation of the hand of
your opponent, you lose. Many poker variants are supported (draw,
holdem, omaha, etc.) and more can be added.  poker-eval is designed
for speed so that it can be used within poker simulation software
using either exhaustive exploration or Monte Carlo.

The poker-eval library is Free Software and is released under the
terms of the GNU General Public License. See the COPYING file in the
root directory of the distribution.

There are two new functions added for doing the 2+2 Evaluator instead
of the StdDeck_StdRules_EVAL_N and StdDeck_OmahaHi_EVAL_N called
StdDeck_StdRules_EVAL_LUT_N and StdDeck_OmahaHi_EVAL_LUT_N
and these use the 2+2 table do the evaluation instead of the standard
pokersource tables but these two cannot be intermingled with calls
to the other evalution routines of the pokersource libray.
StdDeck_Initialize_LUT has to be called with the HandRank.dat file
descriptor (Note: descriptor is used instead of the filepath or FILE*
so that it is easier to call the function from Java JNI using the
FileDescriptor that is used when using the file within an Android
resource. The interface can be changed to filepath or FILE* easily).

Hand parsing code is added to the handdist subdir.

The Hold'em Hand distribution parsing code is from James Devlin with
minor bug fixes.

Omaha Hand Distrbution parsing code is original by Atin Malaviya using the
same interface as James' Hold'em code so make it easy for one program to call
either kind of parser, albeit supporting different syntax for Holdem and Omaha.
The Holdem syntax is the commonly used PokerStove syntax but the input text
syntax is different for Omaha with syntax similar to the Omaha Equilab syntax
with minor changes.
